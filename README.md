Experiments with png layers and animated masks

Using layers of png images, I'm trying to create shaders that modulate between what layer is shown and which is hidden. 

I'm thinking there could be a few different types, it's really similar to what I was doing with the layer distortion stuff, but with gradients affecting alpha.
